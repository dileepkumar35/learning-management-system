Goal
Build a mini Learning Management System (LMS) that lets instructors author courses (modules
→ lessons), students enroll and complete lessons, take auto-graded quizzes, and track
progress — delivered as a runnable app (Docker + docker-compose) with a REST API and
tests.

Problem Statement
Create a small, production-minded LMS that demonstrates end-to-end product and engineering
skills. Instructors must be able to create and manage courses (modules and lessons), add MCQ
quizzes, and view students’ progress. Students must be able to sign up, enroll in courses, read
lessons, complete them, take quizzes (auto-graded), and see a dashboard with progress and
suggested next steps. Provide a documented REST API, database schema/migrations,
unit/integration tests for core business logic, and easy local deployment (Docker). Focus on
correctness, reproducibility, clean API design, and reasonable UX — not on visual polish.

Requirements (must-implement)
1) Authentication & roles
● Email/password authentication (simple; secure storage of passwords required).
● Two roles: student and instructor. (Admin optional.)
● Role-based access control: instructor endpoints restricted.
2) Course & content management
● Instructor CRUD for courses, modules, lessons.
● Lesson fields: title, description, content (text/Markdown), optional video_url
or file reference.
● Lessons ordered within modules.
3) Enrollment
● Students browse courses and enroll (open enrollment).
● Enrollment status exposed in dashboards and APIs.
4) Quizzes & auto-grading
● Instructor can add quizzes (MCQ) per lesson.
● Students take quizzes; MCQs auto-graded immediately; results stored with timestamps
and scores.
5) Student dashboard & progress
● Student dashboard shows: enrolled courses, progress per course (lessons completed /
total), recent quiz scores, and suggested next lesson.
● Mark lessons complete; store completion timestamps.
6) RESTful API & persistence
● Full REST API exposing auth, courses, modules, lessons, enrollment, quiz-taking, and
progress.
● Use PostgreSQL (preferred) or MongoDB. Provide migrations/schema.
7) Tests
● Unit/integration tests covering core endpoints or business logic: enrollment flow,
progress computation, quiz auto-grader, auth flows.
8) Documentation & run instructions
● README with setup, how to run locally, API docs (endpoints + example requests),
design decisions, and known limitations.


Deliverables
● Public Git repository (or zipped project) including:
○ Backend source code + migrations and tests.
○ Frontend source code (or minimal frontend UI) demonstrating flows..
○ README with setup, API docs, sample requests, and design notes.
○ Test suite and how to run it.
○ Hosted Demo Link or short Video

Evaluation Criteria
● Correctness & features — 30%
Required features implemented and working (auth, role checks, course CRUD,
enrollment, lesson completion, quiz auto-grading, progress).
● API design & tests — 25%
Clean RESTful endpoints, clear request/response contracts, and tests for core logic.\
● Data integrity & persistence — 15%
Database schema correctness, migrations, consistent progress calculations, and proper
timestamping.
● Code quality & architecture — 15%
Modular code, sensible folder structure, clear separation of concerns, good error
handling.
● Docs & reproducibility — 15%
README with one-command startup, API docs/examples, and developer notes. Docker
compose works.
